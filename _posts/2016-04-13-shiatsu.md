**[Shiatsu][0]**

Shiatsu, a Japanese term meaning "finger pressure", has an
ancient history and is still a common form of massage in the east. It is also
one of the most well-known forms of massage treatment in the U.S. and is now
practiced in many European countries.

Shiatsu promotes the
natural flow of energy throughout the body. Electricity flows from one point to
another. Those paths in the body are called meridians. When these are
interrupted by stress or injury the body is hindered in its natural functions.
The brain's healing messages are not able to reach needy areas so that repair
can begin. Additional ailments can also result if the situation lingers.
Shiatsu patches these interruptions so the current flows freely and restoration
can begin.

As a trained practitioner, I can detect where there is an
energy blockage and apply Shiatsu massage to restore the proper energy flow to
those areas. As strange as it may sound, an energy blockage in the body is like
a blown circuit.The switch has to be
flipped on again and this can be done through a properly charged touch
correctly applied. This is my specialty. (You may know that it is recommended that
when you pump gasoline, you should first touch something metal on your car
because your body carries current which can lead to an explosion. Computer
technicians wear an anti-static strap around their wrists to release static
electricity build up in the body so it will not damage the equipment they are handling
for installation or repair. These are just two examples of how human touch
carries an electrical charge which can be transferred.)

Shiatsu techniques address affected areas by applying finger,
hand, or elbow pressure in various rhythms, gentle stretching and movement of
joints and other mobilization of the body. Shiatsu can be adapted to need,
ranging from stress reduction to restoration after sports injury, and is widely
appreciated for its medicinal support of the full range of body function.
