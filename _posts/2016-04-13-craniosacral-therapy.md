**Craniosacral **

This form of therapy takes special consideration of the
head, spinal column, and sacrum.

Craniosacral therapy was first developed by osteopath John
Upledger in the 1970s and was based on an approach popularized by Dr. William
Sutherland, an osteopath in the early 1900's. 

The craniosacral system (_cranio_
means head and _sacral_ refers to the
area at the base of the spine) includes the brain and spinal cord. They are
bathed in a craniosacral fluid that has a rhythmic pulse, similar to blood
pressure. The therapist senses the pulse and looks for any subtle restrictions
in the flow of craniosacral fluid.

If a client experiences restrictions in this system problematic
conditions will arise for the nervous system, spine and back, and brain.

Massage of the head, spine, and base of the spine is a
highly effective treatment for injury and pain. For example, joints that have
been impaired by injury or disease regain a wider range of motion; shoulder,
neck and lower back pain are greatly eased through this work; people suffering
from chronic pain often enjoy relief and higher levels of daily
functioning.
