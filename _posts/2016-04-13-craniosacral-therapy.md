## Craniosacral Therapy

This form of gentle therapy takes special consideration of the head, spinal column, and sacrum.

Craniosacral therapy was first developed by osteopath John Upledger in the 1970s and was based on an approach popularized by Dr. William Sutherland, an osteopath in the early 1900s.

The craniosacral system (_cranio_ means head and _sacral_ refers to the area at the base of the spine) includes the brain and spinal cord. They are bathed in a craniosacral fluid that has a rhythmic pulse, similar to blood pressure. The therapist senses the pulse and looks for any subtle restrictions in movement.

If a client experiences restrictions in this system problematic conditions will arise for the nervous system, spine and back, and brain.

Craniosacral Therapy to the head, spine, and sacrum is a highly effective treatment for injury and pain. For example, joints that have been impaired by injury or disease regain a wider range of motion; shoulder, neck and lower back pain are greatly eased through this work; people suffering from chronic pain from injury often enjoy relief and higher levels of daily functioning.

## Shiatsu

Shiatsu, a Japanese term meaning "finger pressure", has an ancient history and is still a common form of massage in the east. It is also a form of massage treatment in the U.S. and is now practiced in many European countries.

Therapeutic and restorative Shiatsu is a slow, deep compression and stretching, finger, hand, or elbow pressure in various rhythms, and movement of joints and other mobilization of the body producing longer lasting relief. Shiatsu can be adapted to need, ranging from stress reduction to restoration after sports injury, and is widely appreciated for its medicinal support of the full range of body function. This muscle work is relaxing and pressure can vary according to client's preference. 

Shiatsu promotes the natural flow of energy throughout the body. Electricity flows from one point to another. Those paths in the body are called meridians. When these are interrupted by stress or injury the body is hindered in its natural functions. Additional ailments can also result if the situation lingers. Shiatsu unblocks these interruptions so the current flows freely and restoration can begin.

As a trained practitioner, I can detect where there is an energy blockage and help restore the proper energy flow to those areas. As strange as it may sound, an energy blockage in the body is like a blown circuit. The switch has to be flipped on again and this can be done through a properly charged touch correctly applied. (You may know, computer technicians wear an anti-static strap around their wrists to release static electricity build up in the body so it will not damage the equipment they are handling for installation or repair. This is just one example of how human touch carries an electrical charge which can be transferred.)
