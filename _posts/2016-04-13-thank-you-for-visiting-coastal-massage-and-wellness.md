Thank you for visiting
Coastal Massage and Wellness!

Accurately understanding
your situation and presenting you with an affordable, effective, and
comfortable treatment option will be my first step to improve your condition.

At Coastal Massage and
Wellness, clients who have not seen significant relief or improvement through a
standard massage approach have found Shiatsu massage and Craniosacral therapy
to be the "missing piece" in their recovery or health support.

My initial exposure to
the spheres of physical therapy and chiropractic care confirmed to me the need
for additional and complementary bodywork to help many people find the relief
they were not, for various reasons, able to achieve via standard treatment
methods.

For this reason I sought
out specialized education and coaching to meet this need. 

**Shiatsu
massage **and **Craniosacral therapy** are my specialties
and are effective methods for pain relief.

I received my training
at the highly respected McKinnon Body Therapy Center in Oakland, California,
and was certified for practice as a massage therapist by the California
Massage Therapy Council.
