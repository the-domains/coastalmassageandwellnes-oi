## What people are saying

_**Emily F.**_

> "Earlier this year I had to undergo dental surgery. Dottie of Coastal Massage was able to use Craniosacral Therapy to really help me in the recovery and healing process. I saw Dottie for therapy leading up to and following the surgery. I also see Dottie for regular Cranio and Shiatsu work. Her massage office is local, which is convenient, but more importantly, her body work is quality and makes a huge difference in my health. Her Main Street location is a little small, but very comfortable!" 

_**Jon T.**_

> "Traveling I always have back trouble. Coastal Massage, resolved the pain in one visit. A great company! I'll come back, if only for the massage and friendly atmosphere!"

_**Eric S.**_

> "Great service, personal, and professional. Have used Coastal Massage twice and would recommend this therapist. Appreciated the availability of appointments when visiting in the area."
