> "Traveling I always have back trouble.  Coastal Massage, resolved the pain in one visit.  A great company!  I'll come back, if only for the massage and friendly atmosphere!" Jon T.

"Earlier this year I had to undergo dental surgery.  Dottie of Coastal Massage was able to use Craniosacral Therapy to really help me in the recovery and healing process.  I saw Dottie for therapy leading up to and following the surgery.  I also see Dottie for regular Cranio and Shiatsu work.  Her massage office is local, which is convenient, but more importantly, her body work  is quality and makes a huge difference in my health.  Her Main Street location is a little small, but very comfortable!" Emily F.
