# **Welcome!**

At **Coastal Massage and Wellness** you will experience therapeutic Shiatsu massage and Craniosacral Therapy. Though less well known, these comfortable and effective approaches are fast becoming preferred choices for many.

Shiatsu includes slow, deep compressions as well as stretches producing long lasting relief. This muscle work is relaxing and pressure can vary according to client's preference. Shiatsu addresses muscle soreness, stiff neck/strain, headaches, spine and back issues, sciatica and other conditions.

Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle therapy, highly effective for pain related to chronic and acute conditions especially neck and back pain, TMJ syndrome, whiplash, and migraines.

## What people are saying

_**Emily F.**_

> "Earlier this year I had to undergo dental surgery. Dottie of Coastal Massage was able to use Craniosacral Therapy to really help me in the recovery and healing process. I saw Dottie for therapy leading up to and following the surgery. I also see Dottie for regular Cranio and Shiatsu work. Her massage office is local, which is convenient, but more importantly, her body work is quality and makes a huge difference in my health."
