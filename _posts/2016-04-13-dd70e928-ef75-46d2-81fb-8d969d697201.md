What is massage therapy? 

Massage therapy stimulates the body's natural ability
to heal. It is a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical,
reinforcement of the body's own regenerative capacity.
There are a variety of modalities, or techniques,
each with a certain emphasis.
What are the benefits?
Massage supports recovery from injury or illness,
can relieve pain and discomfort, and dissipate stress.
Massage also acts as a preventative treatment by
supporting good body function.

As a result of improved circulation in both blood
and lymphatic systems, many recipients of massage
therapy report greater range of motion, relief from
pain, improved sleep, and sense of overall wellness.

Massage can bring relief to many conditions,
including the following:

* Headaches,
migraines

concentrating
