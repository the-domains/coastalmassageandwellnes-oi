# **What is massage therapy?**

Massage therapy stimulates the body's natural ability to heal. It is a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical, reinforcement of the body's own regenerative capacity. There are a variety of modalities, or techniques, each with a certain emphasis. What are the benefits? Massage supports recovery from injury or illness, can relieve pain and discomfort, and dissipate stress. Massage also acts as a preventative treatment by supporting good body function.

As a result of improved circulation in both blood and lymphatic systems, many recipients of massage therapy report greater range of motion, relief from pain, improved sleep, and sense of overall wellness.
