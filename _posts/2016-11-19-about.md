# **About**

Thank you for visiting Coastal Massage and Wellness!

Accurately understanding your situation and presenting you with an affordable, effective, and comfortable treatment option will be my first step to improve your condition.

At Coastal Massage and Wellness, clients who have not seen significant relief or improvement through a standard massage approach have found Shiatsu massage and Craniosacral Therapy to be the missing piece in their recovery or health support.

My initial exposure and work in the spheres of physical therapy and chiropractic care confirmed my love for helping people feel better by supporting the body's natural design toward self-correction through using complementary bodywork. 

For this reason I sought out specialized education and coaching to meet this need. Shiatsu and Craniosacral Therapy are my specialties and are effective methods for pain relief.

I am delighted to service clients in the San Luis County where I was born and raised, fulfilling a long-time dream.

I received my training at the highly respected McKinnon Body Therapy Center in Oakland, California, and was certified for practice as a massage therapist by the California Massage Therapy Council.
