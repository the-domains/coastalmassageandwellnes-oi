# **About**

Thank you for visiting Coastal Massage and Wellness!

Accurately understanding your situation and presenting you with an affordable, effective, and comfortable treatment option will be my first step to improve your condition.

At Coastal Massage and Wellness, clients who have not seen significant relief or improvement through a standard massage approach have found Shiatsu massage and Craniosacral therapy to be the missing piece in their recovery or health support.

My initial exposure to the spheres of physical therapy and chiropractic care confirmed to me the need for additional and complementary bodywork to help many people find the relief they were not, for various reasons, able to achieve via standard treatment methods.

For this reason I sought out specialized education and coaching to meet this need. Shiatsu and Craniosacral Therapy are my specialties and are effective methods for pain relief.

I received my training at the highly respected McKinnon Body Therapy Center in Oakland, California, and was certified for practice as a massage therapist by the California Massage Therapy Council.
